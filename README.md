# BACIL ðŸ¦ 

An experimental interpreter for .NET CIL binaries for [GraalVM](https://github.com/oracle/graal). While it only implements a small subset of the full [ECMA-335 Common Language Infrastructure (CLI) standard](https://www.ecma-international.org/publications-and-standards/standards/ecma-335/), stuff it can run it runs with performance comparable to .NET 5.0's official JIT runtime (citation pending ðŸ˜‡).

The project is written like an interpreter (you will find a familiar `while(true) switch(opcode)` in [BytecodeNode.execute()](language/src/main/java/com/vztekoverflow/bacil/nodes/BytecodeNode.java)), and leverages [Truffle](https://github.com/oracle/graal/tree/master/truffle) and the Graal compiler to turn it into a Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler.

Written as a part of a bachelor thesis called _Truffle based .NET IL interpreter and compiler: run C# on Java Virtual Machine_ at Charles University, Prague. Once the thesis is complete, it will be linked here.

## Building

For ease of building we use [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/), therefore building consists of running `mvn package` in the root of the project.

The resulting artifacts will be the language jar in `language/target/language-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar` and a (shaded) launcher jar in `launcher/target/bacil-launcher.jar`.

## Running

For running you'll need to [obtain GraalVM](https://www.graalvm.org/downloads/) (we test on Java 8 based) and a copy of a .NET standard library. We tested with .NET Runtime 5.0.6 on both Linux and Windows, which you can [obtain here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0).

You'll also need an assembly to run. If you don't have any handy, you can clone [https://github.com/jagotu/BACIL_examples](BACIL_examples).

Once you have all the prerequisites, you can run BACIL on Windows with .NET Runtime 5.0.6 like so:

```
BACIL>java -version
openjdk version "1.8.0_282"
OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_282-b07)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM GraalVM CE 21.0.0 (build 25.282-b07-jvmci-21.0-b06, mixed mode)

BACIL>java -Dtruffle.class.path.append=language/target/language-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar -jar launcher/target/bacil-launcher.jar "--cil.libraryPath=c:\Program Files\dotnet\shared\Microsoft.NETCore.App\5.0.6" BACIL_examples\Inheritance\bin\Debug\net5.0\TestHarness.dll
Micka: Meow
Rex: Woof
Returned 4
Returned: 0
Runtime: 110ms
```

Apart from the last 2 lines (added by BACIL to aid debugging), the output should be identical when running the assemblies directly.

```
BACIL>dotnet BACIL_examples\Inheritance\bin\Debug\net5.0\TestHarness.dll
Micka: Meow
Rex: Woof
Returned 4
```

On Linux it's very similiar:

```
$ java -version
openjdk version "1.8.0_292"
OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_292-b09)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM GraalVM CE 21.1.0 (build 25.292-b09-jvmci-21.1-b05, mixed mode)

$ java -Dtruffle.class.path.append=language/target/language-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar -jar launcher/target/bacil-launcher.jar --cil.libraryPath=../dotnet-runtime-5.0.6-linux-x64/shared/Microsoft.NETCore.App/5.0.6 BACIL_examples/Inheritance/bin/Debug/net5.0/TestHarness.dll
Micka: Meow
Rex: Woof
Returned 4
Returned: 0
Runtime: 348ms

$ dotnet BACIL_examples/Inheritance/bin/Debug/net5.0/TestHarness.dll
Micka: Meow
Rex: Woof
Returned 4

```

Always make sure you are running GraalVM and replace the `libraryPath` with path to the .NET standard library DLLs.
